Learning/practicing Rust (rust-building-reusable-code-with-rust-from-scratch udemy course)
while comparing to concepts familiar to me from haskell 

Rust trait vs Haskell typeclass

    Result enum Result<T, E> { Ok(T), Err(E) } 
    Either  data Either e a = Left e | Right a
    
    Option enum Option<T> { Some(T), None } 
    Maybe  data Maybe a = Just a | Nothing
